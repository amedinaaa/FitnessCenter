# Setup Based On CS 340 Starter Code
The project evolved from the CS 340 starter code. DB Connections and App.js basic setup is all copied/adapted from said code.

# Handlebars Setup
The inspiration behind our handlebars setup was from https://stackabuse.com/guide-to-handlebars-templating-engine-for-node/

We followed the styling, file layout, and custom helpers from this source.

# Adapted styling (CSS file)

# Styling from the aforementioned site was used as a base for project UI with original modifications on borders and background colors for forms and buttons.
