<h2>Welcome to The Fitness Center</h2>

<p>
    The Fitness Center offers rental equipment for many activities and also offers various group exercise sessions and individual activities to its clientele. 
    It serves a local community of 25,000 and has 1500 members.
    The center is currently having issues with double booked activities and overbooked sessions and which is not only becoming a nightmare for the center’s staff but is also a frustrating experience for its members. 
 </p>   
 <p>The database will serve as a management system that will help track available group sessions and equipment, fitness center members, individual activities, and the number of reservations made by members.
