    The Fitness Center offers rental equipment for many activities and also offers various group exercise sessions and individual activities to its clientele. 
    It serves a local community of 25,000 and has 1500 members.
    The center is currently having issues with double booked activities and overbooked sessions and which is not only becoming a nightmare for the centerâ€™s staff but is also a frustrating experience for its members.
